# Datachronism

This is a small project to provide a search engine and a deck building engine for the History Channel card game Anachronism. It first started as a way easily keep track of my decks an cards, but it evolved into a useful tool that anyone who loves and still plays this game to this day can use as well.

## Usage

It has a general search in the top navigation bar, a full filtered search in the left sidebar, and a deck builder in the right sidebar.

You can share the created deck using the corresponding share button. It will generate a unique URL with a hash to identify and share the deck, so you can bookmark it or send it to a friend.

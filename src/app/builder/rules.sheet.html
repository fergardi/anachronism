  <h2 class="primary-color">DECK BUILDING RULES</h2>
  <p>A deck is composed by exactly five <b class="primary-color">cards</b>.</p>
  <p>In the <b class="primary-color">first</b> position you should have a single <b class="primary-color">Warrior</b>.</p>
  <p>In the <b class="primary-color">second</b>, <b class="primary-color">third</b>, <b class="primary-color">fourth</b> and <b class="primary-color">fifth</b> position, you should have a single <b class="primary-color">Weapon</b>, an <b class="primary-color">Armor</b>, an <b class="primary-color">Inspiration</b> and a <b class="primary-color">Special</b>. This order is not mandatory.</p>
  <p>The order is important, as the cards <b class="primary-color">Initiative</b> will determine which <b class="primary-color">Warrior</b> plays first each round.</p>
  <p>You cannot have more than one card of the same <b class="primary-color">Name</b>, nor the same <b class="primary-color">Type</b>, unless specified otherwise.</p>
  <p>You can, however have cards with the same or different <b class="primary-color">Culture</b>, as the game name refers to.</p>
  <p>There are some cards that allows more than one <b class="primary-color">Weapon</b>, <b class="primary-color">Armor</b>, <b class="primary-color">Inspiration</b> and/or <b class="primary-color">Special</b>.</p>
  <p>Your <b class="primary-color">Warrior</b> only has two <b class="primary-color">hands</b>. The requirements for weilding <b class="primary-color">weapons</b> and/or <b class="primary-color">shields</b> must be respected.</p>
  <p>A deck can be technically <b class="warn-color">invalid</b> and still be legal to play, as when you reveal an <b class="warn-color">invalid</b> card, the game forces you to discard cards until the deck becomes <b class="primary-color">valid</b> again.</p>

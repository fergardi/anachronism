A veteran of many wars, Sun Tzu understood the value of information, of drilled troops and of apparently formless strategy. “A great general,” he said, “first wins the battle. Then he fights it”. Sun Tzu’s insights were so acute that his writings today are read and employed by people in every facet of life. On every conceivable battlefield, Sun Tzu continues to lead generals to victory.\n\nProtected by shan wen jia mountain pattern armor, Sun Tzu once again seeks to execute his plan of invulnerability in combat.

He even re-wrote Aztec history and religion to reinforce his radical reforms. By forging an alliance with two city-states, Itzcóatl conquered the Tepanecs in 1428, and ultimately elevated himself to the position of the first of the Aztec Emperors.

Later that year, he founded the Shinsengumi with a man called Kondo Isami, which acted as a police force that fought Imperial Loyalist activities in Kyoto. Hijikata performed his duties with utter conviction, even ordering friends to commit seppuku where the rules of Shinsengumi demanded it. When it became apparent that the Meiji Restoration was on the verge of triumph, he marched into battle one last time, saying that he went to fight harder and better than he ever had before, and to die for his country. Use Hijikata Toshizo, the Demon of the Shinsengumi, to overcome weakness, to fight with conviction, and to give all in the name of defiance and honor.",

He fought alongside his elder brother, Yoritomo, against the Taira Clan, but later turned to fight against him, after Yoritomo moved to usurp Imperial power. Failing to defeat his brother, who installed himself as the first Shogun in Japan’s history, Yoshitsune spent the rest of his life fleeing from Yoritomo’s men. On his travels, he attracted many retainers, including the warrior monk Saito Musashibo Benkei, who swore lifelong fealty. It is said that their loyalty was so great that, when escape finally became impossible, they held off a force many times greater than their own number to allow Yoshitsune to commit seppuku. Use Minamoto no Yoshitsune, humble and dedicated, to oppose those so eager to win power and fame in the Anachronism arena that they would sacrifice all nobility and worth to do so.",

Bringing them to battle at Mikata-ga-hara, he routed their combined forces with ease, but died unexpectedly in 1573 as he launched his next campaign.

While in his mid-teens, he took control of his clan from his brother and began to cement his power. The victories of Takeda Shingen in Shinano Province presented a great threat, and so Kenshin moved against the great warlord. This led to a series of five wars, in which Kenshin came closer than anyone else to defeating the Tiger of Kai. After Shingen died, Kenshin fought against Oda Nobunaga, defeating him at the battle of Tedorigawa, but poor health caught up with him as he prepared to mount a large-scale offensive. Use Uesugi Kenshin, the Dragon of Echigo, to bring your enemies to the point of your blade and defeat all who would oppose your skill in the Anachronism arena.",

Leading the Arab invasion of Egypt, Amr achieved a relatively bloodless conquest of the lands to the east of Cairo. With a stronghold established at Misr al-Fustat, “The Tented City”, the first mosque on the African continent was built, reputedly on the site where Amr had pitched his tent. He then led the conquest of Alexandria in 642, aided by the Coptic Christian population, who suffered frequent persecution at the hands of Alexandria’s Byzantine rulers. Although unquestionably one of the most successful Islamic commanders of his time, divisions remain today as to his worthiness. Use Amr ibn al-Aas, commander of the faithful, to achieve victories on the sands of the Anachronism arena that will last through time.",

When Nicephorus usurped her position and rebuked Harun, his response was swift, sieging and sacking Heraclea. Nicephorus agreed to pay tribute, but immediately reneged, causing Harun to invade again. He defeated an army of 125,000 with only 15,000, and wounded Nicephorus himself. Today, Harun is best remembered as the caliph upon whom the One Thousand and One Nights is based.

After becoming vizier of the caliphate, he succeeded in the extraordinarily difficult task of protecting Egypt against the advances of Amalric I. With the death of the caliph, Salah ad-Din assumed power, revitalising Egypt both militarily and economically. Upon the death of Nur ad-Din, he declared himself Sultan of Egypt. Turning his attention towards the Crusader kingdom, he secured rapid victories, capturing Jerusalem and swiftly taking all Crusader-held cities with the exception of Tyre. A man of incredible tolerance, and renowned for his great generosity and humanism, he was universally lauded in both East and West as the epitome of a noble warrior. Use Salah ad-Din, the paragon of honor, to defeat your foes with the virtue born of a true heart, so that none may question your rule over the Anachronism arena.",

His rule was beset with problems, with the Reformation causing enormous religious unrest and the armies of France and Turkey constantly threatening the borders of his demesne. His campaigns in Italy inadvertently led to the sacking of Rome, which incurred the wrath of the Pope, but also gave him the leverage he needed to prevent the annulment of his aunt’s marriage to King Henry VIII of England. Charles outlawed Protestantism, but was unable to follow up the edict with action, due to continuing aggression from a Turkish-French alliance. After 40 years of rule, during which he overcame obstacles that would have felled lesser men, he abdicated and retired to a monastery. Use Charles V, Emperor, King and Archduke, to calmly thwart the attacks of any enemy, to hold fast, and to guard your rightful rulership over the Anachronism arena.",

Moving north, he fought the Turks, and then later the French again, by whom he was greatly outnumbered. His deployment of trench fortifications, shrewdness, and exceptional patience again secured victory, as his enemies eventually overextended themselves.

Gráinne’s piracy, and numerous clashes with English authority, led to her sons and brother being taken prisoner. She determined to plead with Queen Elizabeth I herself for their freedom, and was granted an audience where she secured their release. In return, Gráinne pledged to attack only the enemies of England, though it is by no means clear that she kept to her word.\n\nUse Gráinne Ní Mháille, proud, fearless and canny, to outwit and outmaneuver your opponents in the Anachronism arena, negotiating the fickle currents of chance to secure victory.",

This earned her the nickname Gráinne Mhaol (\"Bald Grace\") which stuck with her through her life. Gráinne’s piracy, and numerous clashes with English authority, led to her sons and brother being taken prisoner. She determined to plead with Queen Elizabeth I herself for their freedom, and was granted an audience where she secured their release. In return, Gráinne pledged to attack only the enemies of England, though it is by no means clear that she kept to her word.\n\nUse Gráinne Ní Mháille, proud, fearless and canny, to outwit and outmaneuver your opponents in the Anachronism arena, negotiating the fickle currents of chance to secure victory.",

During the second Mithradatic War, several Greek cities on the west coast of the Black Sea requested his help against the Roman general Varro Lucullus, and later joined Burebista's kingdon out of gratitude.

Michael secured his rule over Wallachia with the help of signficant payments from the Ottoman Empire.  Inviting his creditors to dinner, he had them murdered, thus freeing himself of the debt.  This incurred a number of retaliatory attacks by the Ottoman Empire, all of which were repulsed with the aid of Sigismund Bathory, the Prince of Transylvania.  Continuing to fight against the Turks, victories against Cardinal Andrew Bathory and Ieremia Movila secured him the kingdoms of Transylvania and Moldavia.  Michael was assassinated in 1601.\nUse Micael the Brave to strike at enemies on every side and secure victories in the Anachronism arena unlike any seen before you.",

Brought to power by a court conspiracy, in the early years of his reign he was little more than a mouthpiece for his mother, Kösem Sultan. However, in the face of growing anarchy, Murad IV asserted his authority, brutally and effectively reining his kingdom back into line. He had most of the ruling officials executed, including his brothers, slashed wasteful spending, and banned tobacco and alcohol. At night, he would patrol the streets in plain clothes, personally killing any who broke the ban. Militarily, he achieved the last great feat of Ottoman arms, capturing Baghdad in 1638. He died, aged 27, from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nUse Murad IV, cruel and unwavering, to fix your eyes on victory and let none bar your path towards utter dominance in the Anachronism arena.",

At ten years of age, he was sent to tend his family’s cattle herd, though he enjoyed hunting and hiking through the nearby woods far more. Boone served with the British in the French and Indian War. Narrowly escaping the conflict with his life, he became a scout, and was instrumental in early explorations of Kentucky and Tennessee. Twice hostile local tribes captured him, but twice he escaped. He is perhaps best remembered for his work in clearing the Wilderness Road and the establishment of Boonesborough. He died in Marthasville, Missouri, in September 1820. \n\nUse Daniel Boone, trailblazer and explorer, to relentlessly carve a path towards victory in the Anachronism arena.",

However, he is best remembered for trekking over 200 miles across complete wilderness after being attacked by a grizzly bear and badly injured. With only a knife to defend himself, Glass managed to kill the beast, but was so badly mauled that death seemed an inevitability. He was abandoned in the wilderness, but recovered, set his own broken leg, and began the 200-mile journey to Fort Kiowa. In order to prevent his flesh from becoming necrotic, he pressed his back against tree stumps covered with maggots, which cleansed his wounds. He survived, and eventually returned to the mountains. He was killed in battle with Arikaree natives in the winter of 1833. \n\nUse Hugh Glass, grizzly killer, warrior, and survivor, to best any who are brave or foolish enough to challenge you in the Anachronism arena.",

Bowie made a considerable amount of money dealing in illegal slaves and then involved himself in illegal land speculation. With wealth behind him, he was able to indulge his whims, including his famous, if unsuccessful search for the San Saba silver mines. His temper was legendary, and Bowie got himself into numerous fights. The most famous of these, and the fight in which the eponymous Bowie knife first came to prominence, was the Sandbar Fight, fought at Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie’s ferocity and skill quickly became common knowledge, as did the unique qualities of his weapon. Soon, the design of the knife became incredibly popular. Bowie met his end at The Alamo, fighting against Santa Anna. With this, his fame was secured forever. \n\nUse Jim Bowie: brawler, outlaw, knife-fighter, legend, to stamp out any dissension against your claim to the Anachronism arena.",

He was one of the first non-natives to see the geysers of Yellowstone, the incredible qualities of which he described with great gusto (Bridger was renowned for his love of tall tales). Bridger’s Pass, which he discovered in 1850, shortened the Oregon Trail by 61 miles and became the route for Interstate 80. Bridger also served as a scout against Red Cloud in the first Powder River Expedition. He died in July 1881. \n\nUse Jim Bridger, as tough as the Rockies themselves, to outlast all before you and to create an Anachronism legend that will grow with each retelling.",

Returning years later, Agamemnon, with the aid of his brother Meneláos, reclaimed his throne. Agamemnon then launched a series of campaigns to expand his kingdom, and quickly became the most powerful leader in Greece. When Paris, a Trojan prince, eloped with Meneláos’ wife Helen, Agamemnon repaid his debt by bringing the full force of his armies to bear on Troy. A courageous if haughty commander, he performed many heroic deeds during the war. Upon his return to Greece, he was murdered by his wife Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus, who had seduced her in Agamemnon’s absence. \n\nUse Agamemnon, mightiest king among the Greeks, to face your foes with courage and honor, and to win victories in the Anachronism arena worthy of the epics themselves.",

Trained by the centaur Chiron, Telamonian Aias was considered the most valuable warrior in the Greek army at Troy. Called “The Bulwark of the Achaeans,” he was utterly resolute and unwavering, unlike the temperamental Achilles, who was the only man to exceed Aias’ skill at arms. Aias duelled the Trojan hero, Hector, with both men fighting each other to a standstill. They parted friends, having exchanged gifts. Throughout the Iliad, Aias is the only major warrior not to receive aid from the gods, or to be wounded. As such, he stands as an example of determination, perseverance, and spirit. \n\nUse Talmonian Aias, the Bulwark of the Achaeans, to dominate the Anachronism arena through strength and skill, a rock against which your foes can rain but pitiful blows.",

Rebelling, then fleeing to the wilderness, Mattathias passed the task of defeating the Seleucids to his sons. Lacking troops, Judah Maccabee conducted a guerrilla war against Appolonius, the governor of Judea. When Appolonius sought the Judeans out, Judah surprised his army at Nahal el-Haramiah and destroyed it, killing Appolonius in the process. He defeated armies led by Seron and Lysias at Beit Horon and Emmaus respectively before capturing Jerusalem and restoring the Temple. \n\nUse Judah Maccabee, the Hammer, to bring defeat to your enemies, no matter their strength, and to reclaim the Anachronism arena, no matter the odds.",

    background: "Blessed with enormous strength, Samson was, much like Herakles in Greek legend, a greatly flawed character. Falling in love with a Philistine woman, Samson travelled to Timnah to ask for her hand in marriage. On the way, he killed a lion that had attacked him. He later killed thirty Ashkelonites for their clothes, which he owed to his groomsmen. When his father-in-law refused to let Samson see his new wife, he set 300 foxes on fire and let them run through the Philistine vineyards. In retribution, the Philistines sent an army to capture him, but Samson killed 1,000 of them with a jawbone. Samson finally came to Gaza, where he fell in love with Delilah. She betrayed him, and Samson was captured. Finally, blinded and brought to the temple of Dagon, Samson used his strength to collapse the structure, killing almost all present. \n\nUse Samson, mighty of arm, to bring ruin down upon your foes in the Anachronism arena, even at the moment of their apparent victory.",

While in exile in Greece, he found and liberated a group of Trojan slaves, and together they set out on a quest to find a new home. Aided by visions from Artemis, they journeyed to the west. Meeting resistance wherever they went, Brutus and his compatriots fought many battles, eventually coming to an island on the fringes of Europe called Albion. The country was renamed after its new king, becoming Britain. Brutus created a code of laws for his people, and the founding stone of their first city, Troia Nova, now London, is said to guarantee its safety as long as it remains there. \n\nUse Brutus, wanderer, warrior, and king, to seek victory in the Anachronism arena, no matter how long the road, and stamp your name upon its sands for all time.",

While his skill in arms was exceeded by the mighty Achilles, his spirit and nobility outshone all others. His rebuke, “Fight for your country – that is the first, the only omen,” has become synonymous with patriotism across the world. However, great a hero as Hector was, he could not escape his ordained fate. Achilles slew him in personal combat, in retribution for the death of Patroclus. During the Middle Ages, the image and ideals of Hector were held in such high regard that Jean de Longuyon named him as one of the Nine Worthies in his Voeux du Paon, and Dante wrote of him as one of the deserving pagans in his Inferno. \n\nUse Hector, the Bulwark of the Trojans, to demonstrate the greatness of true nobility in the Anachronism arena, and to take your place among the worthiest competitors in all of history.",
